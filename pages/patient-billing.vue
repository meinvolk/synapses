                            Our IONM services requires some of the most advanced technology available, with an entire team of technicians and our physicians, working in concert with your surgeon to maximize efficiency and safety during surgery. In many instances, our IONM services create a charge (bill) for services provided.  While these services are billed separately from your surgical procedure by our billing company, and you will receive either a bill and/or explanation of benefits for the costs of these services, the patient will be responsible only for established deductibles and coinsurance amounts, following the insurance policy rules, as well as state and federal regulations for patient billing and payor compliance. Occasionally the insurance company will send our payments directly to you (a check), and this will need be forwarded to our billing company.
                            </p>
<p>
                            As a matter of policy and federal law, we will forward a bill for services that were provided. Please read letters stating “what you owe” or “patients responsibility” but understand that it is not our policy to collect from our patients directly beyond your portion of the bill ("cost share''), which is required, and in accordance with federal law and insurance plans policy.  We strive to reduce the stress associated with your surgical experience as much as possible, and maximize the success of your surgical procedure when we are able as part of your surgical team.

</p>
<p>
                            Please feel free to contact our billing team with any concerns or needed explanations regarding information with your EOB or insurance carrier statements. We will work with you, the patient, and address your concerns to your satisfaction whenever possible.

</p>
<p>
                            As your healthcare provider for intraoperative neuromonitoring services, will provide you with a Good Faith Estimate in writing at least 1 business day before your procedure. You can also ask our team for a Good Faith Estimate before you schedule your procedure.
